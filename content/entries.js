    body:  "velveeta voldemort’s Justice Department is going full McCarthy mode, launching a questionnaire to identify and potentially purge any FBI personnel who worked on Jan. 6 cases. Agents and staffers are being ordered to disclose whether they arrested rioters, interviewed witnesses, or conducted surveillance—a thinly veiled loyalty test that conveniently targets those who investigated velveeta voldemort and his allies. Meanwhile, mass firings have already begun, with top officials at the Washington field office forced into early retirement and federal prosecutors dismissed en masse. The move has sparked panic within the FBI, with the agency scrambling to reassure employees that the acting director hasn’t been fired (yet). Legal experts warn that these purges violate due process, but velveeta voldemort’s people don’t seem concerned. Even Kash Patel, velveeta voldemort’s FBI director nominee, swore under oath there would be no political retribution—while the administration is very publicly making lists of people to target. Stripping the nation’s top law enforcement agency of its most experienced investigators doesn’t just weaken federal cases—it actively undermines national security, counterterrorism, and organized crime efforts. But hey, when you’re trying to rewrite history and erase accountability, kneecapping the FBI seems like a small price to pay.",

Some of those \“patriots\” he just freed weren’t exactly first-time offenders. Among them are individuals with long rap sheets for rape, child sexual abuse, domestic violence, drug trafficking, and even manslaughter. Take Matthew Huttle, who had a history of child abuse and DUI arrests—pardoned by Trump, then shot and killed in an altercation with law enforcement just days later. Or Theodore Middendorf, convicted of sexually assaulting a 7-year-old, who was set to be sentenced for smashing Capitol windows before Trump made his case disappear. Or Peter Schwartz, a man with 38 prior convictions, including domestic assault and threatening police—who got 14 years for attacking officers with pepper spray on Jan. 6, but is now a free man thanks to Trump. Trump admitted that actually reviewing these cases would have been \"too cumbersome,\" so instead of considering, you know, basic public safety, he just pardoned everyone. Some of these guys still have pending cases for child pornography, illegal firearms, and violent crimes—but hey, as long as they were rioting for Trump, they apparently deserved a free pass. Meanwhile, the same party that screams \“Back the Blue\” just cheered as their leader pardoned criminals who literally beat cops with flagpoles. You can’t make this up.",

    body:  "On February 2, 2025, President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans might experience some discomfort due to the newly imposed tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. He emphasized that this period could usher in a \"golden age of America,\" while conceding, \"Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!).\"  The administration has enacted a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration. These measures are anticipated to prompt retaliatory actions from the affected nations and may lead to significant economic disruptions. Economists and industry experts warn that these tariffs could result in higher consumer prices, particularly in sectors like food and automotive. For instance, U.S. consumers may face increased costs for meat, vegetables, and fruits due to the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. Additionally, automakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen are expressing concerns over potential negative impacts on the automotive industry, given their reliance on vehicles produced in Mexico and Canada. In response, both Mexico and Canada have announced plans to implement retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, signaling a potential escalation into a broader trade conflict. ",

In just weeks, he’s stacked key agencies with his own loyalists, gained access to Treasury systems controlling trillions of dollars, and now seems intent on dismantling USAID entirely.

That’s right, while slashing taxes for the wealthy, they’re looking at squeezing regular workers by treating their job perks as taxable income. Under current law, benefits like employer-covered commuting costs (up to $315/month), free meals, and gym access are not taxed. But if these changes go through, employees could start seeing deductions for things like parking at work or grabbing a snack from the company cafeteria. Companies will then face a choice: eat the tax hit themselves or start axing benefits altogether—neither of which is great for morale. This couldn’t come at a worse time, as more businesses are already forcing workers back to the office. Imagine being dragged back into the daily commute only to find that your free parking is now a taxable expense and your \"perks\" cost more than they’re worth. Even worse? The expected revenue from this tax grab isn’t even that significant—only $157 billion over a decade—compared to the multi-trillion-dollar hole they’re trying to fill. But hey, when you need to make room for another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, might as well nickel-and-dime the workers, right?",

    body:  "Trump’s latest foreign policy masterpiece? Strong-arming Panama over the canal with the grace of a mobster demanding “insurance” money. Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama this weekend is supposed to \“negotiate\” America’s return to dominance in the region, but Panamanian officials are preparing for the worst—including, apparently, the possibility of an invasion. Yes, really. Former Panamanian President Ernesto Pérez Balladares warned that if Trump goes full imperialist, it could lead to mass casualties and international condemnation. But Trump’s team, being the savvy dealmakers they are, has a different strategy: Make Panama an offer they can’t refuse. U.S. officials have reportedly told Panama to start handing out freebies, like letting U.S. Navy ships use the canal toll-free, before Trump gets \“creative\” with his demands. Panama’s response? A mix of disbelief and irritation. They’ve fact-checked Trump’s wild claims about China’s military presence in the canal, pointed out that transit fees are legally set, and even took the issue to the United Nations. Trump’s envoy, however, was unimpressed, reportedly responding with, \“Do you think that we give a shit?\” (Diplomacy at its finest.) Meanwhile, in a nod to Trump’s love of strong-arming allies, Panama has hinted that if things escalate, they might just stop controlling the flow of South American migrants heading north—a move that would flood the U.S.-Mexico border with even more asylum seekers. Of course, this entire mess is fueled by Trump’s paranoia over China. While Panama maintains that Beijing has zero control over the canal, Trump is convinced otherwise and wants to \“take it back.\” The canal was handed over to Panama in 1999, and while America still has defense obligations, the idea of a U.S. takeover is about as well-received in Panama as a root canal without anesthesia. But Trump, ever the real estate guy, seems to think everything’s up for negotiation—even sovereign territory. So, will this turn into a military crisis or just another round of loud, empty threats? If history is any guide, it’ll probably be both.",

    body:  "Elon Musk has apparently decided that running Twitter into the ground wasn’t enough—now he’s applying the same chaos to the federal workforce. A new report details how Musk and his allies have \“taken control\” of the Office of Personnel Management, skipping key officials to blast out a mass email offering buyouts to 2.3 million federal employees. The email, titled \“Fork in the Road,\” mirrors the one Musk sent before gutting Twitter, which should be a comforting sign for government workers everywhere. Normally, the OPM—an independent, nonpartisan agency—would be involved in something this massive, but not under Musk’s watch. Instead, his handpicked allies, including ex-SpaceX and Twitter cronies, are now running the show. Musk’s takeover of the federal workforce is just another step in his growing influence over Trump’s administration, where he’s already been handed control of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE, because of course). Originally meant to be an advisory role, Musk has turned it into his own personal demolition project, reshaping the federal government in Trump’s image. Meanwhile, government employees are understandably wary of the buyout offer, given Musk’s stellar track record of not paying severance and getting sued by former employees. The proposal promises salaries through September 30 with no requirement to return to work—but much like Musk’s promises at Twitter, no one’s really sure if it will hold up. In the end, it looks like Musk is just doing what he does best: gutting institutions, dodging accountability, and making sure the people actually doing the work are the ones who suffer.",

Mexico and Canada wasted no time hitting back with their own tariffs, and China is taking it to the WTO, so congratulations, we’re now in a full-blown trade war. But don’t worry, Trump assures us that tariffs will make America “very rich and very strong”—just ignore the fact that businesses, economists, and, well, anyone who understands supply chains are collectively screaming into the void. And to really twist the knife, he’s closing the de minimis loophole, meaning even small businesses and bargain hunters using Shein and Temu are out of luck.

Even Trump's most loyal Wall Street backers are sounding the alarm, warning that his policies could detonate a speculative bubble. So, as everyday investors anxiously refresh their portfolios, billionaire hedge fund managers are playing both sides—because whether the economy soars or burns, they always find a way to profit. And if Trump ever realizes his biggest financial supporters are now betting on his failure? Well, expect some all-caps rage tweets and a fresh round of finger-pointing.",

Her blood-alcohol content was a staggering .20%, more than double the legal limit. ONLY THE BEST PEOPLE Despite the president being pro violence and giving her mercy for her role in attacking the seat of democracy, the justice system wasn’t as forgiving for taking a life. A judge sentenced her to 10 years for the fatal crash and seven more for the injuries she caused—proving that, in at least one courtroom, accountability still exists for people that aren't rich white assholes.",

In his crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrations, Trump is targeting non-citizen students and residents, revoking visas and threatening deportation for those he deems \“Hamas sympathizers.\” I understand that hamas is a terrorist organization and they can get fucked but what about the first amendment???? Under the new order, federal agencies are tasked with investigating civil rights violations linked to campus protests and taking legal action against anyone accused of antisemitic activity. But the vagueness of the policy raises immediate concerns—who decides what counts as \“sympathizing\” with Hamas? Does chanting \“Free Palestine\” get you kicked out of the country? In this assholes version of America it does. Civil rights groups are already calling this an unconstitutional attack on free speech, likening it to the crackdowns on Vietnam War protesters. Legal experts warn that punishing students based on political speech violates the First Amendment—but Trump and his supporters claim it’s necessary to curb extremism on college campuses. With lawsuits looming and universities now under pressure to track student activism, this order could reshape protest culture in America—not just for pro-Palestinian demonstrators, but for anyone who dares to oppose government policy.",

In a trio of executive orders, Trump is demanding schools drop lessons on systemic racism and gender identity, funneling public money into private schools, and cracking down on pro-Palestinian protesters by threatening deportation. In a move that would make Big Brother proud, federal funding will now hinge on whether schools toe the MAGA line. Teach \“gender ideology\” or \“discriminatory equity ideology\” (translation: acknowledge LGBTQ+ rights or systemic racism)? Kiss that funding goodbye. Meanwhile, Trump’s education secretary now has 90 days to come up with a national censorship blueprint disguised as an \“anti-indoctrination\” plan. But that’s not all—Trump’s school choice order pushes even more taxpayer dollars toward private and religious schools, draining funding from public education. And for the grand finale, student protesters who oppose Israel’s actions in Gaza could have their visas revoked under the pretense of fighting antisemitism, a move that legal experts are already calling blatantly unconstitutional. If you thought the last few years were a battleground for education, buckle up—Trump’s second term is turning the classroom into a full-fledged ideological purge. He wants to make all the kids stupid, after all he loves the poorly educated and learning things turns people into independents or democrats.",

Merrick Garland had withheld it, citing the pending appeal, but now it's up to grumpy’s own DOJ—stacked with his former defense attorneys—to decide if it ever sees the light of day. Spoiler alert: Don’t hold your breath.

While Denmark has firmly rejected the idea, they’re not taking it lightly this time, ramping up military spending and scrambling for European support. Meanwhile, Trump allies in Congress have already introduced a \"Make Greenland Great Again\" Act to back negotiations, and right-wing think tanks are daydreaming about what kind of U.S. territory it could become—just not a state, because, as Heritage Foundation scholars warned, Greenlanders are *gasp* SOCIALISTLIBTARDS. With Greenland’s local government increasingly frustrated with Danish rule, frump may be banking on an independence movement to help him land his prize. But Denmark and the rest of Europe seem to be gearing up for a fight.",

The executive order, which halts funding for a wide range of grants and programs, includes a pause on the Veterans Affairs Department’s suicide prevention and legal services grants, raising alarm among lawmakers and advocacy groups. While the White House insists the freeze is just a temporary “review,” the move directly contradicts Trump’s past rhetoric on supporting veterans. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are downplaying concerns, with some urging people to “stay calm” and “take a deep breath.” Must be nice advice for those not wondering whether lifesaving services will still exist next week.",

    body:  "President Trump has signed an executive order to develop an American-made missile defense system akin to Israel's Iron Dome, aiming to protect the U.S. from potential threats. However, considering the U.S. is flanked by friendly neighbors and vast oceans, the necessity of such a system is questionable. Critics argue that investing in a missile defense shield designed for short-range threats is an imprudent use of resources, especially when the nation faces more pressing domestic challenges. Moreover, the effectiveness of such systems against advanced missile technologies remains a topic of debate among defense experts. In essence, while the initiative may bolster perceptions of national security, but its really just a giant waste of our money, fiscal conservatism right?",

In response, Trump also imposed sanctions, including visa restrictions for Colombian officials. Facing these economic pressures, Colombia was going to retaliate with tariffs of their own. Still, in the end, Colombia agreed to accept the deportation flights, leading the U.S. to pause the tariffs and some sanctions. However, certain restrictions remain until the first deportation flight is completed successfully.

For everyday consumers already grappling with rising costs, this sentiment might come across as a tad out of touch, especially since the grifter in chief was elected on the promise of lowering prices",

He argues that direct funding to states would streamline recovery efforts. However, critics point out that not all states have the resources or infrastructure to handle major disasters independently. But why let details like preparedness and resource allocation get in the way of a good shake-up? I guess that means states like California can keep their disaster money while states like Kentucky are cooked",

    body:  "Intensifying tensions in the Middle East, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders lifting sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, a policy reversal from the previous administration. This decision has emboldened radical settler groups, leading to violent raids on Palestinian villages such as al-Funduq and Jinsafut. Nightwatchman Said Bashir recounted the terror as settlers torched vehicles and damaged properties, actions that occurred under the watchful eyes of Israeli soldiers. Critics argue that these policy changes not only undermine the prospects for a two-state solution but also exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the region. The colonization of Palestinian land and the displacement of indigenous communities have been a recurring theme in the region's history, and the current situation poses a significant challenge to peace efforts.",

The self-proclaimed king of “the art of the deal” now wants to eliminate the debt ceiling entirely, because apparently, when you’ve already ballooned the national debt by nearly $8 trillion during your last term, what’s a few more zeros? So much for fiscal conservatism—the party of balanced budgets is now more like the party of “just put it on the tab.” Critics point out that removing the debt ceiling doesn’t fix reckless spending; it just removes the brakes. But hey, why limit yourself when you can run up the credit card and let the next guy worry about it? Responsible governance, Trump-style!",

Critics argue that for-profit prisons have historically been associated with higher rates of violence and substandard conditions compared to publicly operated facilities. The revival of private prison contracts is expected to benefit major corporations in the industry, raising concerns about the influence of profit motives on incarceration policies.

    body: "In a move that has left thousands of migrant families stranded and desperate, President Donald Trump has terminated the CBP One app, a critical tool that allowed asylum seekers to schedule legal entry into the United States. This abrupt decision, coinciding with his inauguration, has canceled appointments for migrants from countries including Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia, and Peru, who now face uncertainty and despair at the U.S.-Mexico border. The CBP One app, introduced in 2023 during the Biden administration, facilitated nearly 1 million legal entries by allowing migrants to schedule appointments at designated border crossings. Its sudden shutdown has not only invalidated existing appointments but also dismantled a system that provided a safer and more organized pathway for those fleeing violence and poverty. Migrants like Nidia Montenegro, who traveled from Venezuela to Tijuana with hopes of reuniting with family in the U.S., received notifications that their long-awaited appointments were canceled. This policy shift is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to tighten immigration controls, including declaring a national emergency at the southern border and reinstating the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy. Critics argue that these measures not only violate U.S. refugee laws but also exacerbate the humanitarian crisis at the border, leaving vulnerable families in perilous conditions without legal recourse.",
