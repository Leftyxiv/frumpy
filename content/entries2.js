    body:  "<p>Turns out ICE isn’t just rounding people up—they’re also rounding up old press releases, slapping fresh timestamps on them, and letting Google do the rest. Thousands of outdated ICE announcements, some over a decade old, suddenly flooded search results with a brand-new \“Updated: 01/24/2025\” label, making it seem like mass raids were happening nationwide. Convenient timing, given Trump’s latest deportation crusade. Immigration lawyers and tech experts uncovered the scheme, which conveniently disappeared after media inquiries—because nothing says <em>oops, you caught us</em> quite like quietly reverting the timestamps. But the damage was done: panic spread, fear took hold, and Kristi Noem got her photo op in an ICE vest. Mission accomplished.</p>",

The same <strong>Gleason who spent years accusing LGBTQ+ people of “grooming” children</strong>—writing for <strong>The Daily Wire, The Federalist, and The Imaginative Conservative</strong>—has now been <strong>charged with lewd and lascivious molestation of a child</strong>. Funny how <strong>it’s never the drag queens, but always the guys screaming the loudest about them.</strong></p> <p>Of course, <strong>The Daily Wire wasted no time scrubbing his author page from existence</strong>, as if that’ll erase the fact that <strong>he helped push their anti-LGBTQ+ hysteria</strong>. But <strong>the Internet Archive never forgets</strong>, and screenshots show he spent his time writing about Brett Kavanaugh and defending Trump supporters from accusations of being racist, sexist, and homophobic—because of course he did.</p> <p>Gleason <strong>was arrested in Florida</strong>, because where else? He had been working as a <strong>teacher at Rocky Bayou Christian School</strong>, a <strong>fundamentalist conservative institution</strong>, where he had been <strong>on paid leave for two weeks before his arrest</strong>. The school’s <strong>superintendent sent out a vague email to parents</strong> asking for <strong>“prayers” for the school</strong>—because naturally, <strong>they care more about their reputation than the actual child who was harmed.</strong></p> <p>And let’s not forget: <strong>this is the same guy who posted a video of queer protesters chanting “We’re coming for your children” as a joke, and insisted it was proof of LGBTQ+ “grooming.”</strong> Turns out, <strong>he was the only predator in the room.</strong></p> <p>So here’s a fun question for all the <strong>right-wing media outlets that spent years screaming about drag queens, rainbow flags, and school library books corrupting kids</strong>: <strong>when are they going to start talking about the epidemic of child molesters in their own ranks?</strong></p>",

In 2022, someone using a Telegram handle linked to Coristine allegedly sought out cyberattack-for-hire services. Just the kind of experience we need in government, right? Security experts are scratching their heads, wondering how \"Big Balls\" managed to bypass the rigorous background checks that are supposed to prevent, well, exactly this sort of thing.

Here’s the play: Trump fired two key NLRB officials, effectively crippling the board’s ability to enforce labor laws. Whole Foods—disappointed that their workers had the audacity to demand rights—immediately jumped on the opportunity, filing a claim that the NLRB doesn’t have the authority to certify the union election. Because if there’s no functioning labor board, then there’s no one to force them to respect the vote. Genius! Evil, but genius. And just to keep up appearances, Whole Foods is also crying about union \“intimidation\”, because apparently, workers daring to stand up for themselves is the real threat here. Meanwhile, they’ve got an entire corporate anti-union machine working overtime to stall, delay, and crush any attempts at bargaining. Let’s be real—this isn’t about the legality of the NLRB’s authority. It’s about Amazon and Whole Foods refusing to accept that their workers are sick of being exploited.

A shopping list of tax cuts that would funnel billions into the pockets of the ultrawealthy and corporations while gutting benefits for single parents, low-income families, and anyone who relies on Medicaid. Because nothing screams populism like yanking healthcare from poor people to finance another billionaire tax break. At the top of their wishlist: eliminating the estate tax, which only affects fortunes over $14 million (because heaven forbid the top 0.1% chip in after death). Then there's a corporate tax cut from 21% to 15%, which would make the U.S. one of the lowest-taxed rich nations—a nice little giveaway for executives already drowning in stock options. So how do they plan to pay for this loot drop for the elite? Oh, just by slashing Medicaid, eliminating childcare tax credits, and gutting tax breaks for single parents—because if there’s one thing the GOP hates more than the IRS, it’s helping struggling families survive. The biggest slap in the face? Killing the \“head of household\” filing status, which would jack up taxes on single parents—mostly moms—by nearly $200 billion over a decade. Meanwhile, they’re tossing a shiny distraction to service workers by eliminating taxes on tips, a policy Trump pushed in Vegas to win over hospitality workers. Never mind that the bulk of the tax plan screws over low- and middle-income earners—as long as they get one good headline, right?

That money funds the NIH, CDC, and countless public health initiatives, but now? It’s in the hands of Luke Farritor, a Musk crony who’s already delaying payments like he’s some dystopian overlord deciding who deserves healthcare today. And this isn’t some isolated oopsie. DOGE has already wormed its way into Treasury’s payment systems, which handle Social Security and Medicare disbursements—because apparently, we’re all cool with an unelected tech bro having a \“read-only\” peek at grandma’s Social Security check. Treasury claims DOGE can’t mess with payments (yet), but funny how that’s exactly what they said about HHS right before payments started mysteriously \“delaying.\” This is Musk's empire-building by force, dressed up as \“efficiency.\” They aren’t streamlining government; they’re looting it. And like any good heist crew, they’re banking on nobody stopping them until it’s too late.",

Meanwhile, NOAA staff, marine conservationists, and anyone with a functioning brain are pointing out that gutting the agency will lead to overfishing, increased seafood fraud, and, oh yeah, fewer storm warnings—so good luck with that next tornado outbreak.

In the latest round of ideological purging disguised as \“efficiency,\” the entire CIA workforce has been offered buyouts, because nothing says national security like gutting the country’s intelligence apparatus and replacing career professionals with Trump loyalists. According to reports, Trump’s handpicked CIA director John Ratcliffe—fresh off his stint as director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term—has put the agency on a hiring freeze and is rescinding offers for anyone who doesn’t align with the administration’s new priorities. And what are those priorities? Not traditional intelligence work, of course. Instead, Trump’s CIA will be laser-focused on \“targeting drug cartels,\” fueling the trade war, and \“undermining China.\” So, basically, intelligence operations are now just an extension of Trump’s personal vendettas. The buyout scheme is part of Trump’s broader effort to slash the size of government while installing as many loyalists as possible. This week, millions of federal workers were offered a golden parachute to quit and keep their pay until September, all while Trump’s conservative manifesto Project 2025 outlines mass firings and replacing career professionals with political hacks. The CIA’s inclusion in this program appears to have been a last-minute decision—because who needs experienced intelligence officers when you can just wing it? At this point, the administration isn’t even pretending this isn’t a power grab. They’re gutting the very agencies responsible for keeping the country safe, and if a few classified operations get derailed in the process? Oh well. Nothing matters but loyalty.",

Not help rebuild it, not assist in humanitarian aid—just straight-up take it over and ship the people elsewhere to some vague, “fresh, beautiful piece of land.” You know, because nothing screams peace and stability like forced displacement and a colonial land grab. Sitting next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump floated his plan to transform Gaza into a luxury development project, casually dismissing the Palestinians' desire to stay in their homeland. \“I do see a long-term ownership position,\” Trump declared, as if he were discussing a prime beachfront property instead of a war-torn region home to 2.2 million people. And naturally, Netanyahu—always up for a little annexation talk—was open to the idea, calling it a potential \“change in history.\” That’s one way to describe it. Trump, who once called Gaza a \“phenomenal location\” with \“the best weather,\” has essentially proposed turning it into a high-end international community (Palestinians optional), all while ignoring the reality that Gaza belongs to the Palestinians. But hey, when you think the world is just a Monopoly board, why let international law or basic human rights get in the way?

That’s right, under Musk’s direction, a bunch of 19-to-24-year-old amateurs now have access to Social Security numbers, home addresses, medical records, salaries, and disciplinary records of millions of government workers. What could possibly go wrong? Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—which, let’s be real, is basically a Silicon Valley frat party with security clearance—has seized control of USAJOBS, the federal hiring database, and Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI), which holds everything from performance reviews to employee health records. And what are they doing with all this access? Oh, just hunting down diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices for elimination, as confirmed by OPM employees. Because in Musk’s twisted worldview, government waste isn’t contractors overcharging for military jets—it’s diversity hiring. And just to really sweeten the deal, the whole system is comically insecure. Government cybersecurity experts are freaking out because China and Russia are literally trying to hack these databases every single day, and Musk’s unvetted team just plopped a commercial server into the mix like it’s their personal Discord bot. The incompetence is already showing: a new email list Musk’s team set up last week was immediately flooded with spam. But hey, what’s a little massive data breach potential when you’re busy purging career civil servants who don’t meet Musk’s ideological purity test? Meanwhile, actual government officials have been locked out of their own systems, leaving Musk’s crew free to make undetectable, irreversible changes to federal records. You know, just casually rewriting the U.S. civil service in real-time. But don’t worry—if you ever expressed mild concern about email security in 2016, this is definitely the moment to panic.",

In a midnight X call that sounded like a libertarian fever dream mixed with a Wall Street grift seminar, Musk declared that regulations should be \“default gone\” and, if necessary, added back later—because nothing screams responsible governance like treating public safety, environmental protections, and financial oversight like a software update. Flanked by Trump cheerleaders like Vivek Ramaswamy and GOP senators Joni Ernst and Mike Lee, Musk hyped this as a \“now or never\” moment to gut the government while the Supreme Court is stacked in their favor. And just in case anyone missed the point, he patted himself on the back for gutting USAID, bragging on X that he had \“fed it into the wood chipper.\” That’s right—U.S. humanitarian aid is now a casualty of Musk’s personal war on bureaucracy, with career staff locked out of their systems, classified info handed over to Musk’s band of Silicon Valley toddlers, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio casually declaring himself its new boss.

Musk even bragged about canceling $1 billion in federal contracts, gleefully trampling over the Impoundment Control Act, because why not? This isn’t just regulatory rollback—it’s a hostile takeover of the federal government by a tech billionaire and his handpicked disruptors, with zero oversight and a clear contempt for the rule of law.

That’s right: if they want to keep slapping their name on tacky t-shirts, they’ll need permission from the very people they terrorized. This poetic justice stems from a $2.8 million judgment against the group after its former leader, Enrique Tarrio, and his goons decided to torch a Black Lives Matter banner at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. When the Proud Boys didn’t cough up the cash, the church went for their most valuable asset—their name—and won. Tarrio, freshly pardoned by Trump in his mass January 6 clemency spree, is predictably throwing a tantrum, ranting about the church losing its nonprofit status and demanding the judge be impeached. (Because nothing says \“rule of law\” like pardoning domestic terrorists while calling for judges to be removed when they rule against you.) Meanwhile, the ruling means that any Proud Boys chapter hoping to keep their brand alive now has to get a nod from the church they tried to intimidate. A more humiliating corporate takeover has never been seen. From street brawlers to intellectual property casualties—this is what happens when a gang of wannabe fascists meets actual consequences.",

Because, naturally, when picking the person responsible for overseeing America’s most sensitive intelligence operations, why not go with someone widely suspected of being a Russian asset and who once went on a lovely meet-and-greet with Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, a dictator known for gassing his own people? Truly an inspired choice. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman and military veteran, has spent years positioning herself as the GOP’s favorite ex-Democrat, cozying up to right-wing media circles and parlaying her isolationist rhetoric into a Trump-world job offer. During her confirmation hearing, she refused to call NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden a traitor—because apparently, compromising national security isn’t that big of a deal when you also happen to be a Kremlin favorite. Meanwhile, concerns over her past meetings with Assad—whom she once seemed disturbingly sympathetic toward—were conveniently brushed aside in favor of her latest rebrand as a MAGA-friendly \“straight shooter.\” Naturally, Senate Republicans, eager to prove that their national security credentials are now entirely theoretical, rallied behind her. Even GOP senators who might have raised an eyebrow at a nominee with this many foreign entanglements chose to look the other way. Because, really, what’s a little Russian intrigue and dictator diplomacy among friends? Now, Gabbard heads to a full Senate vote, where she'll need a simple majority to take the reins of America’s intelligence community. If confirmed, expect U.S. intelligence assessments to start including a lot more \“both sides\” arguments when discussing adversarial regimes and maybe a few flattering op-eds about Putin slipped into the daily briefing.

    body:  "Ah, the NFL—always at the cutting edge of corporate backpedaling. Commissioner Roger Goodell spent his annual press conference reassuring everyone that the league is deeply committed to diversity efforts—so much so that they’re quietly phasing them out. This year’s Super Bowl will mark the first time since 2021 that “End Racism” won’t appear in the end zones, because apparently, the league feels that actually ending racism is a little too controversial these days. Instead, we’ll get the much softer, completely apolitical messages of \“Choose Love\” and \“It Takes All of Us\”—because if there’s one thing racism responds well to, it’s a gentle pep talk. Officially, the NFL insists that this decision has nothing to do with the country’s political climate and everything to do with recent tragedies, like wildfires and a plane crash—because, as we all know, systemic racism and natural disasters are basically the same thing. Unofficially, at least one high-ranking league official has expressed concern that this just so happens to align perfectly with Trump’s push to erase DEI initiatives across corporate America. Just a coincidence, surely. Speaking of Trump, he’ll be in attendance at the game as a guest of Saints owner Gayle Benson, which means we’re in for a night of awkward crowd shots and at least one painfully forced handshake. Meanwhile, Goodell also addressed the Rooney Rule, which continues to function as the NFL’s favorite performative gesture. Despite its existence, the current hiring cycle will likely result in just one minority head coach hire out of seven openings, because, as always, the rule is more about optics than actual progress. So, in summary: The NFL definitely still cares about diversity, as long as it doesn’t make anyone too uncomfortable. End racism? Too bold. Vague, feel-good slogans? Perfect. And if Trump’s presence at the game makes certain fans nostalgic for the days when players kneeling during the anthem was the league’s biggest controversy, well—Goodell is more than happy to pretend none of that ever happened.",

    body:  "Ah yes, the latest episode of YamTit's Revenge Tour: FBI Edition. In a move that absolutely doesn’t scream authoritarian purge, the Justice Department is compiling a handy little list of every FBI agent who dared investigate Trump or his beloved January 6 foot soldiers. Because nothing says “law and order” like making sure law enforcement officers are punished for doing their jobs. Now, some pesky FBI agents—who apparently don’t appreciate being turned into targets for right-wing vigilantes—have filed lawsuits to block this blatant political hit list. They’re arguing that being named on this list could lead to unlawful firings. To make things even more hilarious, Trump’s DOJ swears that this is all totally normal, just a routine little personnel review—never mind the part where the acting deputy attorney general, a former personal Trump lawyer, is overseeing the whole thing. I’m sure it’s just a coincidence that this comes right after Trump promised his base a good old-fashioned reckoning for anyone who held his insurrectionists accountable. Of course, the FBI tried to play it safe by only handing over employee numbers instead of actual names, but let’s be real—does anyone believe for a second that the goons running the DOJ won’t connect the dots? These agents are up against an administration that has already fired senior FBI officials, purged January 6 prosecutors, and handed out pardons like candy to Trump’s favorite insurrectionists. So now we wait to see if the courts step in to stop this dystopian nonsense, or if we’ll just move straight to the part where Trump loyalists start knocking on doors with pink slips and a copy of The Art of the Deal. Either way, the message is loud and clear: the white house is a criminal enterprise",

    body:  "Edward Kelley, a 35-year-old from Maryville, Tennessee, was convicted in November 2024 of plotting to murder FBI agents who were investigating his involvement in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. While awaiting trial for his actions during the Capitol breach, Kelley developed a \"kill list\" targeting FBI personnel and conspired to attack the FBI's Knoxville office using car bombs and drones equipped with incendiary devices. He was found guilty of conspiracy to murder federal employees, solicitation to commit a crime of violence, and influencing a federal official by threat, facing a potential life sentence at his scheduled sentencing in May 2025. In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued a blanket pardon for individuals involved in the January 6 events. Kelley's attorney has filed a motion to dismiss the charges related to the FBI murder plot, arguing that these charges are connected to the Capitol insurrection and thus covered by the presidential pardon. The motion contends that without the initial indictment for the Capitol riot, the subsequent case concerning the alleged plot against FBI agents would not have been pursued, asserting that the cases are \"clearly related to one another.\" As of now, federal prosecutors have not publicly responded to the motion to dismiss. Kelley remains in custody at the Blount County Jail, awaiting his sentencing in May.",

    body:  "another heartwarming chapter in the saga of Elon Musk and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Transparency. As Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) steamrolls its way through federal agencies like a billionaire-funded frat party with admin privileges, the world’s richest man and his newly acquired Justice Department lapdogs have a dire warning: Say our names, and we’ll make you pay. After Wired had the audacity to publish the names of six of Musk’s fresh-faced wrecking crew—tech bros barely old enough to rent a car but somehow entrusted with U.S. Treasury systems—Musk predictably lost his mind. The supposed free speech absolutist quickly labeled the act a crime (which it is not) and then used his personal authoritarian playground, X, to scrub the post. But why stop at tech censorship when you can weaponize the Justice Department? Enter Ed Martin, Trump’s hand-picked D.C. U.S. Attorney, who not only backed Musk’s tantrum but also threatened vague legal action against anyone who so much as inconveniences DOGE staffers. Because obviously, the biggest threat to national security right now is people knowing that a gang of unqualified Silicon Valley interns is playing God with federal finances. To make things even better, Martin—who, fun fact, just fired 30 federal prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases—has decided that exposing government employees engaged in dubious actions is the real crime. His bizarre love letter to Musk promises full legal retaliation against those who \“impede\” DOGE’s work, as if people should be grateful that their Social Security payments are now managed by guys who would normally be troubleshooting their failed crypto startups. Meanwhile, the internet has responded with the kind of raw, unfiltered judgment you’d expect, as memes circulate featuring the fresh-faced DOGE operatives with captions like \“Mamas, come get your babies out of our government.\” Even Musk fanboys seem torn, with some in awe that government infiltration is apparently this easy. But let’s be real—this isn’t about protecting public servants from threats. It’s about Musk and Trump trying to operate in the shadows while dismantling institutions they don’t like. And now, they’re turning to weaponized law enforcement to silence anyone who dares to say the quiet part out loud. So, while DOGE hijacks federal agencies and democracy itself, just remember: If you expose the people running the coup, you’re the real criminal.",

The Trump administration, in its latest masterstroke of compassionate governance, has begun flights to the infamous naval base, repurposing the facility once reserved for terrorism suspects into a migrant detention center. Because clearly, the answer to a broken immigration system isn’t reform—it’s exile. This dazzling display of policy ingenuity follows Trump's directive to expand Guantanamo’s capacity to hold up to 30,000 detainees, with \“high-priority criminal aliens\” being the first to take a one-way trip. The administration insists this is all about efficiency, but critics, including human rights groups, have pointed out the glaring ethical and logistical nightmare of detaining asylum seekers in a remote military facility with a well-documented history of, let’s call it, \“unconventional hospitality.\” Advocacy groups are understandably concerned, raising questions about detainees' access to legal representation, medical care, and, you know, basic human rights. But don’t worry—Trump’s immigration team, now featuring the best and brightest from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), surely has it all under control. Who needs due process when you can just reroute the problem to an offshore prison?",

An EPA spokeswoman described the change as \"common practice,\" but critics argue that it undermines the agency's integrity and its commitment to unbiased environmental protection. This development aligns with recent actions under the Trump administration, including the dismissal of all members of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and the Science Advisory Board. Acting EPA Administrator James Payne stated that this decision aims to \"reset\" these panels to ensure their scientific advice complies with the EPA's legal obligations. However, such moves have raised concerns about the increasing politicization of the agency's scientific endeavors. The potential demotions and restructuring efforts have heightened fears among EPA staff and environmental advocates about the future direction of the agency. There is growing apprehension that these actions could compromise the EPA's mission to protect human health and the environment by prioritizing political agendas over scientific integrity. ",

This potential downsizing targets employees involved in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy projects.

    body:  "mango unchained's war on education is kicking into high gear with a new executive order aimed at gutting the Department of Education from within—they say theyre for the little guy then turn around and do shit like dismantling federal oversight, slashing funding, and booting civil rights enforcement. Musk’s rogue ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ (DOGE) is already burrowing into the agency, with its tech-bro interns reportedly gaining access to sensitive financial aid data. Meanwhile, Republicans are torn between their decades-old dream of axing the department and the logistical nightmare of actually doing it. But let’s be real—this isn’t about efficiency or savings; it’s about gutting protections, weakening oversight, and turning public education into a political plaything.",

Because why just help an ally fighting off an invasion when you can turn it into a resource grab? He claims Ukraine is ‘willing to do it,’ but Zelenskyy is making it clear that any backroom deals without Ukraine’s involvement are ‘dangerous.’ Meanwhile, Trump is still pretending he has some secret plan to magically end the war—because nothing says ‘stable genius’ like leveraging a humanitarian crisis for a mining deal. Emboldened by the meek GOP bitches in congress failing to impeach him last time, he's shaking down zelenskyy again. what an embarrassment ",

All of this conveniently timed for Netanyahu’s White House visit, because why just cater to right-wing extremists at home when you can do it abroad too?",
