The statistic originated from a completely unscientific survey, yet it’s been parroted by Trump, Elon Musk, and top GOP officials as justification for gutting the federal workforce. Even after fact-checkers torched the claim, the administration doubled down, weaving it into its mass firings and office closures. The reality? More than half of federal employees are required to work in person daily, and remote work averages just 10%. But in Trump’s post-truth world, the facts don’t matter—only the destruction of government does.</p>",
