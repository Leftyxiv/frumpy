Oh sure, let's keep the most vulnerable around the globe in a holding pattern with a government so mired in incompetence it can't even follow a court's orders without throwing a tantrum worthy of a toddler denied candy. While starving kids and ill patients wait for their lifesaving shipments, the administration whines about “arbitrary timelines” while treating humanitarian needs as a mere footnote in their grand scheme to reshape the administrative state. And what’s next? Aid to those in desperate need is deemed a “legitimate claim” only to be met with bureaucratic stonewalling and the kind of chaos that makes one wonder if these people even remotely grasp the grave stakes involved, or if they’re simply too busy lining their own pockets and catering to the whims of their billionaire buddies to care. This isn’t just incompetence; it’s a corruption of the fundamental moral duty to help those in need, all while smugly drafting thin excuses about presidential power.
