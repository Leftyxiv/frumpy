Judge Beryl A. Howell served up a reality check, reminding us that there are indeed <b>limits</b> to executive power, unlike Trump’s delusions. Wilcox's return highlights not just executive overreach but also the utter incompetence of a presidency that couldn't even execute a simple dismissal without landing in court. Welcome back to the clown show, where a fired employee becomes the agency's savior and Trump's blunders are just becoming the punchline!</p>",

Alcohol, drugs, and unsafe speed played a delightful trio in this lethal symphony of stupidity, but hey, at least they were driving a *futuristic* vehicle, right?
